## What is MongoDB Node.js Core Driver ?

The MongodDB Node.js Core driver is a low level driver meant for people building libraries on top of MongoDB and who do not need the additional complexities of the native end user driver nor all the extra scaffolding and helpers.

## What does the driver offer

The MongoDB core driver offers an extensible library exposing a minimal API. All the plumbing including authentication is all in this driver and as it's much smaller than the legacy 1.X driver it should be much easier to understand.
